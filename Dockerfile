# Dockerfile for the google-surf-mcp server.
#
# Includes Chromium + Xvfb so the image can auto-bootstrap a warm profile
# during build (no human interaction needed). End-to-end functional after
# build, validates cleanly against MCP introspection.
#
# Note: the baked profile is build-time state. For long-running production
# use, mount your own host-bootstrapped profile:
#   -v $HOME/.google-surf-mcp:/root/.google-surf-mcp
